    "pp.deep_groove_ball_bearings.description1": "Deep groove ball bearings are widely used in motors, household appliances, instruments, automobiles, and agricultural machinery due to their simple structure, ease of use, and low cost.",
    "pp.deep_groove_ball_bearings.feature": "The raceways of deep groove ball bearings form continuous deep arc-shaped grooves, allowing them to withstand both radial and bidirectional axial loads. They are especially suitable for high-speed applications. With low friction, high limiting speed, simple structure, and low manufacturing cost, they are the most commonly used and versatile type of bearing.",

    "pp.taper_roller_bearings_data.description1":"Tapered roller bearings are widely used in automobiles, rolling mills, mining, metallurgy, reducers, agricultural machinery gearboxes and other industries.",
    "pp.taper_roller_bearings_data.feature":"Tapered roller bearings can bear radial and axial joint load. It has inner and outer conical raceway,in which taper rolls are arranged.All the projection lines of the conesueface are meeting at the same point of bearings axis.Tapered roller bearings is usually a separated type bearings,that is,the inner components consisting of inner cine, rolls and cage and cup can be installed separately.",
